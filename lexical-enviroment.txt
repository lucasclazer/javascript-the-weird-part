JavaScript cares about Lexical Enviroment that means that your
code has similatiry to computer instructions in the way that
your code was written. In other words the computer will organize the code
in memory likely as the written code.


code example:

function hello(){
    var a = 'hello word';
}

Computer instructions structure:
    function x
         variable y
